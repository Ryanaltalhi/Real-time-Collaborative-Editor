<h1>Real-time Collaborative Editor<h1/>

The Real-Time Collaborative Editor is a web-based application that allows multiple users to collaboratively edit and share text in real-time. This project aims to facilitate seamless collaboration among individuals working on the same document, enabling them to view changes made by others instantaneously and fostering efficient teamwork.

Features:
<ul>
 
<li>Real-Time Collaboration: Users can simultaneously edit the text content within the editor, and any changes made by one user are instantly reflected in the editor for all other connected users.</li>

<li>Multi-User Support: The collaborative editor supports multiple users at the same time, enabling teams or individuals from different locations to work together effortlessly.</li>

<li>Text Synchronization: The application ensures that the text content remains synchronized across all connected instances, preventing conflicts and maintaining a consistent document state.</li>

<li>User Cursors: Collaborators' cursors are visually displayed within the editor, providing real-time visibility of their presence and actions, enhancing the collaborative experience.</li>

<li>Easy Setup: The project uses Node.js, Express, and Socket.IO to create a lightweight server for real-time communication, making it easy to deploy and run on different environments.</li>
 

</ul>
